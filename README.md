## Math Anim

This is a quick and dirty math animation library I am creating for personal use. It should work on any Windows machine, but I am not testing it on any other platforms as of right now. It's main purpose will be to quickly and easily render mathematical animations in real time as well as render mathematical animations to video files.

### Current Features

Right now this library can

* Animate any parametric equation over time
* Draw a grid of arbitrary width
* Draw basic lines

### Planned Features

This library is planned to support

* Render to video files (.mp4, .mov, etc)
* Draw coordinate marks
* Animate and draw text in any font format
* Animate text over time
* Animate interpolations transitioning from one curve to another
* Draw arbitrary shapes
* Draw textured quads
* Animate camera movements
